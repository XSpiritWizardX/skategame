Add a <div class="setup"> block before the Start button with labeled controls: #setting-difficulty (easy/normal/hard), #setting-environment (park/street/warehouse), #setting-mute (checkbox), #setting-reduced-motion (checkbox). Keep the existing Start button within the same overlay/card container and add brief helper text for each control.
