- Extend the overlay in `public/index.html` with a setup step (difficulty select, environment select, toggles for mute + reduced motion) and keep the Start button on the same card.
- Create `public/settings.js` to load/save settings to localStorage, expose a `getSettings()` object, and emit a `settingschange` event when controls change.
- Update `public/game.js` to read settings at run start and apply to physics (base speed, gravity, obstacle spawn cadence) and visuals (background class, particle density).
- Add minimal styles for the setup controls in `public/styles.css`, including focus and keyboard states.
