Insert a new `<div class="setup">` block inside the existing start overlay/card before the Start button. Add labeled controls with the exact IDs `#setting-difficulty` (easy/normal/hard), `#setting-environment` (park/street/warehouse), `#setting-mute` (checkbox), and `#setting-reduced-motion` (checkbox). Include short helper text under each control and keep the Start button in the same container so setup and launch remain one flow.
